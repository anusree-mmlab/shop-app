Multi thread model","    1. Each request is handled by each thread","    2. When the no. of req becomes high- the requests need to wait to get allocated to a thread [This can be solved my allocating more resources- which in turn is costly]","    3. The multi thread model causes blocks/ bottlenecks on the resources that they are accessing until they finished execution","    4. It works using thread pool","#2. Single thread model","    1. It works in an event driven way","    2. Each request is in the event queue, which will be processed asynchronously","    3. So there is no thread pool or block on the resource is not there",""]},{"id":5,"section":"basic","question":"Callback hell","answer":[" 1.
